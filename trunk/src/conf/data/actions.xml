    as form data is defined in the way MODULE.FORMNAME.[g|e].[0-9]*(.[0-9])+ 
      there is additionally need to define the source of the action 
    using those definitions one need to take care of the elements order set
      inside the form configuration
    
    another way could be a "defines" flag to determine the action element
      when recognizing a request with e.g. "core.login" elements those refer
      to the configurtion conf/html/form/login.xml
      if such a file does not exist drop those request parameters
