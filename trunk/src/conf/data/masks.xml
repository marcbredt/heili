    * source and target define where data comes from and goes to
    * necessary for e.g when static forms are created from xml but their 
      result should be stored in the database
    * in such cases source="file", target="db" an additional atribute
      "sfile" is used to define the form data specifiyng the target columns
      to be able to check values passed againt their database target
      column type
    * "db" means data comes from the database and therefor the "uses" attribute
      in the statements file is used to check input data against the column
      type of each "uses" column defined
    * it is allowed to create complex form data variables passing some kind
      of request parameters in a tree structure like source="s1|s2"
    * additionally if source type "db" is set the merged "uses" attributes
      provide the form data structure allowed to be passed which e.g. creates
      an allowed form variable for database statement tree source="s1|s2" -
      having uses="t1.a" and uses="t2.b" set - that can look like
        COLUMN_VALUE[_COLUMN_VALUE]*=COLUMN_VALUE or more specific
        a_VALUE=b_VALUE 
      where VALUE is always checked against the corresponding column type
      which is in this case the type of t1.a and t2.b 
    * mask names must validate the form MODULE:MASK:TEMPLATE:TYPE
