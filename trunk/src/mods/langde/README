* language system is bound to the core
* any additional language module need to contain all files with static text
  * LANG.xml, e.g. en.xml containing all static language texts
  * errors.xml containing all error texts for this language
* masks to handle the frontend view can be provided
  * via mask/php/MASK.php
  * the default mask used is bound to the core core/mask/php/lang/lang.php
* additional database relations will be (interactively) created and set upon
  installation, see Languages section in the project's README
