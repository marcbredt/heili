   *       stor - For any storage segment the number and type of an
   *              objects attributes define the minimum amount of
   *              bytes neccessary for the segment. E.g. if only
   *              integers are stored the maximum length for integer
   *              is about 11 (-2147483648) for negative ones. Knowing 
   *              this we can assume a length of round about 20 for
   *              each entry which allows to store about 50 integers
   *              in a segment with a size of 1KB. Regarding objects
   *              with an avaerage amount of 10 attributes 1KB can 
   *              hold up to 5 objects. Any string or object encap-
   *              sulation blows this up and therefor any usage 
   *              when storing data needs to be calulated before.
   *              With the information above in mind a segment size
   *              of 1MB should be enough for normal use. Increase
   *              this value for excessive use.
